# Ideas:
- Battle Stages
- Character details
    - Equipment
- Account leveling
- Cap idle gains to 24 hours?
- Equipment shop
    - Refresh daily
    - Generate shop items from a stored seed
- Quests
    - Total experience accumulated
    - Total levels cleared
    - Level up a character
    - Buy an item


# Currency types:
- All currency accumulated via idling should be on a per second basis to prevent need for tracking partial accumulation
- Player Experience
  - Contributes to account level
  - Limits character level
  - Obtainable through idling (1 per second per level cleared?) and first-time level rewards
- Experience Shard
  - Used to level characters

# Characters
- Up to 5 stars
  - 1* = 50% chance
  - 2* = 25% chance
  - 3* = 15% chance
  - 4* = 7% chance
  - 5* = 3% chance
- Base stats for all rarities are the same (higher rarity not necessary in the early game)
- Higher stars have higher stat gain per level (higher rarity will be better in the late game)
- One roll costs 3600 diamonds or 10 rolls for 32400?
- Start with 3 1* character?
- First gacha guarantees a 3* character?
